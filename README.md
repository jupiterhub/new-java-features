# Jupiter's conclusion
**Java 8**
- With the introduction of lambdas, code is much cleaner and lesser.
- Streams are a great way to loop, filter, reduce, flatten collections.
- Parallelism is also as easy as changing a method. However there are pitfalls that aren't so obviousand  cost a lot of process if not used well. ( https://blog.jooq.org/2014/06/13/java-8-friday-10-subtle-mistakes-when-using-the-streams-api/).
- Overall I'd recommend utilizing these features now as code is more readable. There is a curve but it's worth it after a while.
